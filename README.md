# Localhost

This gem provides a convenient API for generating per-user self-signed root certificates.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/localhost/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/localhost/actions?workflow=Development)

## Motivation

HTTP/2 requires SSL in web browsers. If you want to use HTTP/2 for development (and you should), you need to start using URLs like `https://localhost:8080`. In most cases, this requires adding a self-signed certificate to your certificate store (e.g. Keychain on macOS), and storing the private key for the web-server to use.

I wanted to provide a server-agnostic way of doing this, primarily because I think it makes sense to minimise the amount of junky self-signed keys you add to your certificate store for `localhost`.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/localhost/).
